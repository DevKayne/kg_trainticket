# About

Thanks for Downloading QB Train Ticket!

It's a pretty simple script where you can buy a Ticket and Tag On/Off Trains,
If you have a Transit Guard Job they can check other Player's Tickets.

# Installation

1. Put this at the Bottom of your Shared/Items.lua
   ['train_ticket'] = {['name'] = 'train_ticket', ['label'] = 'Train Ticket', ['weight'] = 0, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'security_card_01.png', ['unique'] = false, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true, ['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'A Ticket for the LSC Metro System'},

2. Configure the Script to your desire.

3. Install into the server-data/resources/[qb] folder.
